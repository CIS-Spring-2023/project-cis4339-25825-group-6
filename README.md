# Data Platform Project Setup

This project has been developed over time by students in the CIS 4339 course.

The current iteration is based on development done by Elliot Farmer Garcia, Agatha	Molski and Chris	Blanco in Fall of 2022.
This version is the result of a collaboration between Helmut Brenner and Afras Wadiwala in the Spring of 2023.

PLEASE NOTE: Our group only has 2 people so we were told to do approximately 2/3rds of the requirements. The only requirement that we did not do 
was the dynamic display of services. Everything else we worked on and implemented.

Requirements:

This project uses NodeJS and MongoDB.

## Backend Node Application
```
cd backend
```
Follow instructions in backend README for setup and running as a local instance.

## Frontend Vue 3 Application
```
cd frontend
```
Follow instructions in frontend README for setup and running as a local instance.
